A scannable, navigable layout surface for multiple items.

the idea
--------

From time to time in the course of web developent we find ourselves with a number of elements that we would like to arrange in a 2d space.  If we have the room, we just slam down a relatively positioned div and are done.  Often times, however, this space needs to be larger than the realestate available on the page.  

Enter fiche.

Fiche provides us with a viewport of a given size into a surface of any size.  Elements are added and absolutely positioned onto the suface and become visible through the viewport.  When navigating through the elements the surface moves while the viewport stays constant.
